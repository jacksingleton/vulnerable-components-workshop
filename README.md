# Vulnerable Components Workshop


## [Getting started as a participant](README-participant.md)

## Value

> Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, almost
> always run with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such
> an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications
> using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses
> and enable a range of possible attacks and impacts.

After this workshop participants will be aware of the risk potentially
vulnerable components pose to the security of their application. They
will be familiar with the basic sources of vulnerability disclosures
and able to find out if any known issues exist for the versions of
components that they are using. They should know about the basic
strategies for preventing vulnerabilities though third party
components.
